# Anem Llegint

Anem Llegint is a small blog that I created for my mother (Laura Casanovas Borrell).
You can find the published website in the following domain: http://anemllegint.com

The website has three main parts:

1. BOOKS --> Information & review of books
2. QUOTES --> Literary quotations from famous authors
3. ABOUT --> A little bit of information about the blog writer


Information for developers
==========================

This blog isn't a professional project, so the code you'll find here isn't clean and has lots of unneccessary comments and ```console.log()``` statements
